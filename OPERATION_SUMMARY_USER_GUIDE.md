## 💡 **Tips**

### **Understanding the Numbers**:
- **Files Processed**: Shows how many files were actually copied
- **Directories**: Folder structure created/updated
- **Data Transferred**: Actual bytes written to destination
- **Average Speed**: Overall transfer rate (useful for performance tuning)

### **What If Numbers Don't Match?**:
- **0 Files but Success**: Destination already has all files (synchronized)
- **High file count but low data**: Many small files copied
- **Low file count but high data**: Few but large files copied
- **Slow speed**: Could indicate disk performance, network speed, or many small files
